**Object Category** : Object category, such as Named, Revisioned, Service etc., are represented in
the Metamodel as interface types. There are also some abstract base classes defined in the
Metamodel framework to fulfil this requirement. See the section ‘Base Class Library’ for some
additional details.

**Special Fields** : Fields like ‘Name’ property of a Named object or a ‘Revision’ Field of a
Revisioned objects are special fields with certain specific behavior defined as per the
Metamodel design. They are implemented as specific types in the ‘Base Class Library’ that
could be used to represent these Usages on the Field definitions.
